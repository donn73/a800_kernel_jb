How to compile
--------------
1. cd kernel
2. Check compiler path at kernel/newbuild.sh & kernel/clean.sh and replace your own.
3. ./newbuild.sh
4. compiled kernel and modules goes to build_result directory.

Get working lcm, touchpanel, cell, wifi, bt, gps, mic, phone speaker, earpiece, fmradio but still need to fix audio (speaker) and camera.
The current touchpanel and lcm driver are not really good.
Still need to fix bma222 calibration.


Camera
------
The original camera lens are
FM50AF
DW9714AAF (unable to find a proper driver)

Original camera sensors :
HI542MIPI
HI542_MIPI_RAW
OV5647MIPI

Speaker
-------
Seem No problem in kernel driver or gpio pinout, must be a ROM/library issue.
I was trying 4.0.13 kernel from OT997D source, the speaker driver is amp_yad and gpio pinout is GPI68.

Recomended build environment
----------------------------
Ubuntu 10.04.4 (64-bit)
arm-linux-androideabi-gcc 4.6 (get from AOSP)
host gcc 4.4.3
jdk 1.6.0_29

Test this kernel with P770 ROM, only replace kernel & modules with new one.
